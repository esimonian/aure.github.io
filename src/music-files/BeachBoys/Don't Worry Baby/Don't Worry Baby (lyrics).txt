Well, it's been building up inside of me for oh, I don't know how long.
I don't know why, but I keep thinking something's bound to go wrong.
But she looks in my eyes, and makes me realize when she says

  Don't worry baby, ev'rything will turn out alright.
  Don't worry baby. Ooh.

I guess I should have kept my mouth shut when I start to brag about my car.
But I can't back down now because I pushed the other guys too far.
She makes me come alive, and makes me want to drive when she says

CHORUS

SOLO

She told me "Baby when you race today, just take along my love with you.
And if you knew how much I love you baby, nothin' could go wrong with you."
Oh what she does to me when she makes love to me, and she says

CHORUSES OUT
