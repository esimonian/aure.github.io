  Oooh, merry Christmas Saint Nick
  (Christmas comes this time each year)
  Oooooooh

Well, way up north where the air gets cold
There's a tale about Christmas that you've all been told
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red
And he spends the whole year workin' out on his sled
It's the little Saint Nick
It's the little Saint Nick

Just a little bobsled, we call it old Saint Nick
But she'll walk a toboggan with a four speed stick
She's candy apple red with a ski for a wheel
And when Santa hits the gas, man, just watch her peel
It's the little Saint Nick
It's the little Saint Nick

<i>A-run run reindeer (4x)
He don't miss no one</i>

And haulin' through the snow at a fright'nin' speed
With the half a dozen deer with the Rudy to lead
He's gotta wear his goggles 'cause the snow really flies
And he's cruisin' every pad with the little surprise
It's the little Saint Nick
It's the little Saint Nick

  Ahhh, merry Christmas Saint Nick
  (Christmas comes this time each year)
  REPEAT CHORUS OUT
