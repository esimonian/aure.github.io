  It's the little old lady from Pasadena

The little old lady from Pasadena
Has a pretty little flowerbed of white gardenias
But parked in a rickety old garage
Is a brand new, shiny red Super Stock Dodge

  And ev'rybody's sayin' that there's nobody meaner
  Than the little old lady from Pasadena
  She drives real fast and she drives real hard
  She's the terror of Colorado Boulevard
  It's the little old lady from Pasadena

If you see her on the street, don't try to choose her
You might drive a goer, but you'll never lose her
Well, she's gonna get a ticket now sooner or later
'Cause she can't keep her foot off the accelerator

  CHORUS

MUSICAL INTERLUDE (like 2 lines of a Verse)
The guys come to race her for miles around
But she'll give 'em a length and she'll shut 'em down

  CHORUS

Come on, Granny, go, baby
Come on, Granny, go (Repeat out)
