Surfin' is the only life, the only way for me.
  Now surf, surf with me (Bomp bomp dip di-dip di-dip x2)

I got up this mornin' turned on my radio
I was checkin' out the surfin' scene to see if I would go
And when the DJ tells me that the surfin' is fine
That's when I know my baby and I will have a good time, and we're going

Refrain: Surfin' (Bomp bomp dip di-dip di-dip x8)
CHORUS

From the early morning to the middle of the night
Any time the surf is up the time is right
And when the surf is down, to take its place...
We'll do the Surfer Stomp, it's the latest dance craze. Then we're going

REFRAIN
CHORUS

Now the dawn is breakin' and we really gotta go
But we'll be back here very soon, that you better know
Yeah my surfin' knots are risin' and my board is losin' wax
But that won't stop me baby 'cause you know I'm comin' back, and going

REFRAIN

Surfin' is the only life, the only way for me.
Now come on pretty baby and surf with me
(Bomp bomp dip di-dip di-dip OUT)
