Do you wanna dance and hold my hand
Tell me baby I'm your lovin' man
Oh baby, do you wanna dance?

Do you wanna dance under the moonlight
Hold me baby all through the night
Oh baby, do you wanna dance?

  Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
  Do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?
  Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you wanna dance?

Do you wanna dance under the moonlight
Just kiss me baby all through the night
Oh baby, do you wanna dance?

Do you wanna dance under the moonlight
Squeeze me, squeeze me all through the night
Oh baby, do you wanna dance?

  CHORUS
