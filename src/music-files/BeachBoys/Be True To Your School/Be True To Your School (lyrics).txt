When some loud bragger tries to put me down
And says his school is great,
I tell him right away, now,
What's a-matter buddy, ain't you heard of my school?
It's number one in the state.

  So be true to your school, now,
  Just like you would to your girl or guy.
  Be true to your school, now,
  And let your colors fly.
  Be true to your school.

I got a letterman's sweater, with the letter in front,
I got for football and track.
I'm proud to wear it, now,
When I cruise around the other parts of the town,
I got a decal in back. CHORUS

On Friday, we'll be jacked up on the football game,
And I'll be ready to fight.
We're gonna smash 'em now,
My girlfriend will be workin' on her pom-poms, now,
And she'll be yellin' tonight. CHORUS
