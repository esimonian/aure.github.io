  BACKUP VOCALS IN EVERY CHORUS:
  Awh, keep dreamin' it* darlin', ooh ooh
  My darling you're so fine
  Awh----------

Don't know if words could say
But darlin' I'll find a way
To let you know what you've meant to me
Guess it was meant to be
I hold you in my heart
As life's most precious part

  Woh darlin', I dream 'bout you often, my pretty darlin'
  I love the way you've softened my life with your love
  Your precious love uh huh. Oh!

I was livin' like half a man
Then I couldn't love but now I can
You've picked me up when I'm feelin' sad
A-more soul than I ever had
Gonna love ya every single night
'Cause I think you're too outta sight

  Oh hoh darlin', I dream 'bout you often, my pretty darlin'
  I love the way you've softened my life with your love
  Your precious love uh huh huh

Woah ooh woh oh hoh
Every ni-hight woh darlin'

Gonna love you every single night, yes I will
'Cause I think you're too doggone outta sight

  Darlin', I dream 'bout you often, my pretty darlin'
  I love the way you've softened my life with your love
  Your precious love uh huh. Oh!
