We wish you a merry Christmas,
We wish you a merry Christmas,
We wish you a merry Christmas,
And a Happy New Year!

Now bring us some figgy pudding,
Now bring us some figgy pudding,
Now bring us some figgy pudding,
And bring it right now!

We won't go until we get some,
We won't go until we get some,
We won't go until we get some,
So bring it right now!

Good tidings to you,
Wherever you are;
Good tidings for Christmas
And a Happy New Year!
