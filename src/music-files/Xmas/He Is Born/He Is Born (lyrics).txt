Now is born the Divine Christ Child.
Play the musette, play the tuneful oboes!
Now is born the Divine Christ Child.
Let all sing and rejoice this day!

Ages long since are past and gone
When the wise men foretold His coming.
Ages long since are past and gone!
N&#246;el, N&#246;el then let us sing!

Now is born the Divine Christ Child.
Play the musette, play the tuneful oboes!
Now is born the Divine Christ Child.
Let all sing and rejoice this day!

He was born in a stable bare,
On bed of straw now He sleeps so soundly.
He was born in a stable bare,
Bow in homage to Him now.

Now is born the Divine Christ Child.
Play the musette, play the tuneful oboes!
Now is born the Divine Christ Child.
Let all sing and rejoice this day!
