While shepherds watched their sheep by night,
Glad tidings brought an angel bright.
How great their joy! (Echo)
Joy, joy, joy! (Echo)
Glory to God in heav'n on high! (Echo)

"Fear not at all," he said to them,
"Jesus is born in Bethlehem!"
How great their joy! (Echo)
Joy, joy, joy! (Echo)
Glory to God in heav'n on high! (Echo)

"There shall ye find in stable mean,
Christ who shall save the world from sin."
How great their joy! (Echo)
Joy, joy, joy! (Echo)
Glory to God in heav'n on high! (Echo)

Jesus we hasten to adore,
Grant us Thy blessing ever more.
How great our joy! (Echo)
Joy, joy, joy! (Echo)
Glory to God in heav'n on high! (Echo)
