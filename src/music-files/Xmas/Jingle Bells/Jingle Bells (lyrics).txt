Dashing thro' the snow, in a one-horse open sleigh;
O'er the fields we go, laughing all the way; 
Bells on bobtail ring, making spirits bright;
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight. Oh,

  Jingle bells! Jingle bells! Jingle all the way!
  Oh! What fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh!
  Jingle bells! Jingle bells! Jingle all the way!
  Oh! What fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh!

A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride,
And soon Miss Fannie Bright was seated by my side.
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot.
He got into a drifted bank, and we, we got upsot. Oh,

REPEAT REFRAIN

Now the ground is white; go it while you're young; 
Take the girls tonight, and sing this sleighing song.
Just get a bobtailed bay, two-forty for his speed,
Then hitch him to an open sleigh, and crack, you'll take the lead. Oh,

REPEAT REFRAIN
