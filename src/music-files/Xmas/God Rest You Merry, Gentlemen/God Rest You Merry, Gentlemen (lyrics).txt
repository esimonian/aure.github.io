God rest you merry, gentlemen, let nothing you dismay.
Remember, Christ our savior was born on Christmas day,
To save us all from Satan's pow'r, when we were gone astray,
O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

The Shepherds at those tidings rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks a-feeding in tempest, storm and wind;
And went to Bethlehem straight 'way, the Son of God to find.
O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.

Now to the Lord sing praises, all you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood, each other now embrace.
This holy tide of Christmas all other doth deface.
O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy,
O tidings of comfort and joy.
