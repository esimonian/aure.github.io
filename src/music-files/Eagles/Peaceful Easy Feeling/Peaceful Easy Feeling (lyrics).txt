I like the way your sparklin' earrings lay
Against your skin so brown
And I want to sleep with you in the desert tonight
With a billion stars all around

  'Cause I got a peaceful easy feelin'
  And I know you won't let me down
  'Cause I'm already standing on the ground

And I found out a long time ago
What a woman can do to your soul
Aw, but she can't take you any way
You don't already know how to go

  And I got a peaceful easy feelin'
  And I know you won't let me down
  'Cause I'm already standing on the ground

I get this feelin' I may know you
As a lover and a friend
This voice keeps whispering in my other ear,
Tells me I may never see you again

  'Cause I get a peaceful easy feelin'
  And I know you won't let me down
  'Cause I'm already standing
  I'm already standin'
  Yes I'm already standin'
  On the ground
