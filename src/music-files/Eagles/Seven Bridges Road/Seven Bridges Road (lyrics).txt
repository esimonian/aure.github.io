There are stars in the southern sky
Southward as you go
There is moonlight and moss in the trees
Down the Seven Bridges Road

Now I have loved you like a baby
Like some lonesome child
And I have loved you in a tame way
And I have loved you wild

<i>Sometimes, there's a part of me
Has to turn from here and go
Runnin' like a child from these warm stars
Down the Seven Bridges Road</i>

There are stars in the southern sky
And if ever you decide you should go
There is a taste of time-sweetened honey
Down the Seven Bridges Road
