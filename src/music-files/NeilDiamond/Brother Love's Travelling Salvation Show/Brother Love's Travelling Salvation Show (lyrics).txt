Hot August night, and the leaves hangin' down
And the grass on the ground smellin' sweet.
Move up the road to the outside of town
And the sound of that good gospel beat.

<i>Sits a ragged tent where there ain't no trees
And that gospel group, tellin' you and me.</i>

  It's Love, Brother Love, say Brother Love's
  Travellin' Salvation Show.  Halle!  Halle!
  Pack up the babies and grab the old ladies.
  And everyone goes, 'cause everyone knows
  Brother Love's show.

Room gets suddenly still, and when you'd almost bet
You can hear yourself sweat, he walks in.
Eyes black as coal, and when he lifts his face,
Every ear in the place is on him.

<i>Starting soft and slow, like a small earthquake.
And when he lets go, half the valley shakes.</i>

CHORUS

Hallelujah!  Halle Hallelujah! (Vamp through "sermon")

<i>Take my hand in yours, walk with me this day.
In my heart I know, I will never stray.
Halle! (8x)</i>

CHORUS     Amen.
