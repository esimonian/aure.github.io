Oh, when the sun beats down
And burns the tar up on the roof
And your shoes get so hot
You wish your tired feet were fireproof

Under the boardwalk, down by the sea, yeah
On a blanket with my baby's where I'll be

  (Under the boardwalk) out of the sun
  (Under the boardwalk) we'll be havin' some fun
  (Under the boardwalk) people walking above
  (Under the boardwalk) we'll be falling in love
  Under the boardwalk, boardwalk!

From the park you hear
The happy sound of a carousel
Mm-mm, you can almost taste
The hot dogs and French fries they sell

REPEAT PRE-CHORUS

REPEAT CHORUS

SOLO (verse form)  Oh,

REPEAT PRE-CHORUS

REPEAT CHORUS
