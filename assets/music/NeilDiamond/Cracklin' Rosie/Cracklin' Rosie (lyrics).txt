Ah, Cracklin' Rosie get on board.
We're gonna ride 'till there ain't no more to go.
Takin' it slow, and Lord, don't you know.
I'll have me a time with a poor man's lady.

Hitchin' on a twilight train.
Ain't nothing here that I care to take along.
Maybe a song to sing when I want.
Don't need to say please to no man for a happy tune.

  Oh, I love my Rosie child.
  You got the way to make me happy.
  You and me, we go in style.
  Cracklin' Rose, you're a store bought woman.
  But you make me sing like a guitar hummin'.
  (So) hang on to me girl, our song keeps runnin' on.
  Play it now, play it now.  Play it now, my baby.

Cracklin' Rosie make me a smile.
Girl, if it lasts for an hour, well that's all right.
'Cause we got all night to set the world right.
Find us a dream that don't ask no questions, yeah!

CHORUS
