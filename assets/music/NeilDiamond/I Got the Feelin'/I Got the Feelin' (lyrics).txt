Oh no no no no, baby something's wrong.
Oh no no no no, that old time fire is gone.
It's not so much the things you say, love,
It's what you don't say I'm afraid of.

  I got the feelin' I'm hearin' goodbye.
  Don't have to say it, it's there in your eyes.
  Oh why, oh my...

Oh no no no no, you don't smile the same.
Oh no no no no, like you been hidin' the pain.
I love you so much I can taste it,
But girl, your eyes tell me it's wasted.

CHORUS

Oh no, oh no no. Oh no baby

  I got the feelin' I'm hearin' goodbye.
  I got the feelin' that I'm gonna die.
  I got the feelin', oh yes I do.
  I got the feelin' that I'm losin' you.
  I got the feelin'.
  I got the feelin'.
