I thought love was only true in fairy tales,
Meant for someone else, but not for me.
Love was out to get me.  That's the way it seems.
Disappointment haunted all my dreams.

  Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer.
  Not a trace of doubt in my mind.
  I'm in love, and I'm a believer,
  I couldn't leave her if I tried.

I thought love was more or less a givin' thing.
Seems the more I gave, the less I got.
What's the use in tryin', all you get is pain.
When I needed sunshine, I got rain.
