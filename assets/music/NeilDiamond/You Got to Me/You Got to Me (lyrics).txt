Mama she always told me it would happen,
But she never said that it would happen like this.
Papa said some little girl 'll catch you nappin'.
Some little girl 'll get to you with her kiss.

  You got to me.  You brought me to my knees.
  Never thought I'd say it: Please, girl!
  (You got to me)  Got to my soul.
  (You got to me)  You got control.
  (You got to me)  You got to me.  You've got to be mine.

Used to slip through every girl's hands like water.
Never was one who could ever tie me down.
Straight ahead and steady as Gibraltar,
Until you brought me tumblin' to the ground.

CHORUS / INTRO / HARMONICA

(Backups) "Down on your knees; baby say please" (2x)

CHORUS / INTRO

You got to me  (Repeat and fade)
