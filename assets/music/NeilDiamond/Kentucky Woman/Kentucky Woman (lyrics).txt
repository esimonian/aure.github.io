Kentucky woman, she shines with her own kind of light.
She'll look at you once, and a day that's all wrong looks alright.
And I love her.  God knows I love her.

  Kentucky Woman...
  If she gets to know you,
  She's goin' to own you.
  Kentucky Woman.

Well, she ain't the kind make heads turn at the drop of her name.
But something inside that she's got turns you on just the same.
And she loves me.  God knows she loves me.

CHORUS

<i>I don't want much.  The good Lord's earth beneath my feet.
Gentle touch from that one girl and life is
Sweet and good.  Ain't no doubt, I'm talkin' about</i>

Kentucky woman.
