Where it began, I can't begin to knowin'.
But then I know it's growin' strong.
Was in the spring, then spring became the summer.
Who'd 've believed you'd come along?

<i>Hands touchin' hands.
Reachin' out.  Touchin' me touchin' you!</i>

  Sweet Caroline... good times never seemed so good.
  I've been inclined to believe they never would,
  (1st chorus) But now I     (2nd chorus) Oh no no

Look at the night, and it don't seem so lonely.
We fill it up with only two.
And when I hurt, hurtin' runs off my shoulders.
How can I hurt when holdin' you?

<i>Warm... touchin' warm.
Reachin' out.  Touchin' me touchin' you!</i>

INTRO

Sweet Car-o-line!
