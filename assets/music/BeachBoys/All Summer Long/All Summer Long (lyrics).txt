Sittin' in my car, outside your house.
'Member when you spilled Coke all over your blouse?
T-shirts, cutoffs, and a pair of thongs.
We've been havin' fun all summer long.

<i>All summer long, you've been with me.
I can't see enough of you.
All summer long, we've both been free.
Won't be long till summertime is through...
Not for us, now.</i>

Mini'ture golf, and Hondas in the hills.
When we rode our horse, we got some thrills.
Ev'ry now and then, we hear our song.
We've been havin' fun all summer long.

<i>SOLO like Bridge lines 1-3
Won't be long till summertime is through...
Not for us, now.</i>

Ev'ry now and then, we hear our song.
We've been having fun all summer long.

We've been having fun all summer long. (REPEAT OUT)
