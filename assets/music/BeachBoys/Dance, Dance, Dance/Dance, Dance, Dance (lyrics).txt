After six hours of school, I had enough for the day. 
I hit the radio dial, and turn it up all the way. 
 
(1st time: I gotta) (after that: I love to) 
Dance, right on the spot.  The beat's really hot. 
(Dance, Dance, Dance, now the beat's really hot) 
(Dance, Dance, Dance, right there on the spot) 
(Dance, Dance, Dance, now the beat's really hot) 
(Dance, Dance, Dance, yeah!) 
 
When I feel put down, I try to shake it off quick. 
With my chick by my side, the radio does the trick. 
 
REPEAT CHORUS 
 
GUITAR SOLO 
 
At a weekend dance, we like to show up last. 
I play it cool when it's slow, and jump the end when it's fast. 
 
REPEAT CHORUSES OUT
