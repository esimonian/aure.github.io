We met when she was younger.
Then, I had no eyes for her.
A few years went by, and I saw her.
Now, I'm gonna try for her.
Spoken: Look out, babe.

  She's not the little girl I once knew (repeats)

How could I ever have known that
She'd be what she is today?
And look at how her boyfriend holds her.
I'll be moving in one day.
Spoken: Split, man.

CHORUS

<i>Lah-doo-day, uh-bow-bow-bow (repeats)</i>
