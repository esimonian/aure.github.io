Little deuce coupe.  You don't know, you don't know what I got.

Well I'm not braggin' babe, so don't put me down,
But I've got the fastest set of wheels in town.
When something comes up to me, he don't even try,
'Cause if it had a set of wings, man I know she could fly.

  (She's my) Little deuce coupe.  You don't know what I got.

Just a little deuce coupe with the flathead milled,
But she'll walk a Thunderbird like she's standing still.
She's ported and relieved, then she's strobed and bored.
She'll do a hundred and forty in the top end, floored.     CHORUS

<i>She's got a competition clutch with four on the floor,
And she purrs like a kitten 'til the Lake Pipes roar.
And if that ain't enough to make you flip your lid.
Here's one more thing... I got the pink slip, daddy!</i>

And comin' off the line, when the light turns green,
Well, she blows 'em out of the water like you never seen.
I get pushed out of shape, and it's hard to steer
When I get rubber in all four gears.     CHORUSES OUT
