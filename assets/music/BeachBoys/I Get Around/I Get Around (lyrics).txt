Round round get around, I get around, yeah,
Get around, I get around.

  I get around, from town to town.
  I'm a real cool head. I'm makin' real good bread.

I'm getting' bugged drivin' up and down this same old strip.
I gotta find a new place where the kids are hip.

My buddies and me are gettin' real well known,
Yeah, the bad guys know us and they leave us alone.

  CHORUS

I get around, round, get around-round-round-round.
(Solo) Wah, wah-ooh. Wah, wah-ooh. Wah, wah-ooh-ooh.

We always take my car, 'cause it's never been beat,
And we've never missed yet with the girls we meet.

None of the guys go steady, 'cause it wouldn't be right
To leave your best girl home, now, on Saturday night.

  CHORUS

I get around, round, ooh-------

Round round get around, I get around, yeah,
Get around, I get around.

CHORUSES OUT
