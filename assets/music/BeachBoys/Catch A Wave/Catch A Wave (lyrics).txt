Catch a wave and you're sittin' on top of the world

Don't be afraid to try the greatest sport around
Everybody tries it once ----------
<i>Brian: Those who don't, just have to put it down</i>
You paddle out, turn around and raise, and baby,
That's all there is to the coastline craze, you gotta
Catch a wave and you're sittin' on top of the world

Not just a fad cause it's been goin' on so long
All the surfers going strong ----------
<i>Brian: They said it wouldn't last too long</i>
They'll eat their words with a fork and spoon, and watch 'em,
They'll hit the road and all be surfin' soon, and when they
Catch a wave they'll be sittin' on top of the world

SOLO
Catch a wave and you're sittin' on top of the world

So take a lesson from a top-notch surfer boy
Get yourself a big board ----------
<i>Brian: But don't you treat it like a toy</i>
Just get away from the shady turf, and baby,
Go catch some rays on the sunny surf, and when you
Catch a wave you'll be sittin' on top of the world

<i>(Way up high, up on top of the world)</i>
