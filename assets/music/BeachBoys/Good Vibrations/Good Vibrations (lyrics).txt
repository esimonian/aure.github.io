I, I love the colorful clothes she wears,
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair.
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air.

  I'm pickin' up good vibrations,
  She's givin' me the excitations.
  (Add: Ooh bop bop, good vibrations, bop bop, excite)
  Good, good, good, good vibrations.
  Good, good, good, good vibrations.

Close me eyes, she's somehow closer now.
Softly smile, I know she must be kind.
When I look in her eyes,
She goes with me to a blossom world.

CHORUS

<i>Huh... Oh my my.
I don't know where, but she sends me there.
Oh my my, what a sensation.
Oh my my, what elation.</i>

Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happ'nin' with her.

Na na na na na, na na na (keep repeating)
Add: Ba-pa-ba-pa-ba, bom (keep repeating)
Add: Doot doot, etc. (keep repeating)
