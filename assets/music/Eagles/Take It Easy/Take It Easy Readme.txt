Hi there,

I started out with Encore, then moved to Sibelius, then Finale... and now I'm back to Sibelius and sticking with it.  These Encore charts are ancient, and since I don't feel like relearning Encore to edit them, the Sibelius charts are the way to go, for reasons of both appearance and musical content.  (And the PDFs are made from the Sibelius.)

Thanks,
Alan Deane
