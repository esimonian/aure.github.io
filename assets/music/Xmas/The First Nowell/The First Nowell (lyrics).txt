The first Nowell, the angel did say,
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.

Nowell, nowell, nowell, nowell,
Born is the King of Israel.

They looked up and saw a star 
Shining in the East beyond them far.
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.

Nowell, nowell, nowell, nowell,
Born is the King of Israel.

Then entered in those wise men three,
Full rev'rently upon their knee,
And offered there in His presence,
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

Nowell, nowell, nowell, nowell,
Born is the King of Israel.
