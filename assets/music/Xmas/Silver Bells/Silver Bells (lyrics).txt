City sidewalks, busy sidewalks, dressed in holiday style,
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas.
Children laughing, people passing, meeting smile after smile,
And on ev'ry street corner you hear.

Silver bells, silver bells, 
It's Christmas time in the city;
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring,
Soon it will be Christmas day.

Streetlights, even stoplights blink a bright red and green,
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures.
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch, this is Santa's big scene,
And above all this bustle you hear.

Silver bells, silver bells, 
It's Christmas time in the city;
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring,
Soon it will be Christmas day.
