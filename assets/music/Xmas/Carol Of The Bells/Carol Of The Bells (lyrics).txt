Hark! How the bells, sweet silver bells,
All seem to say "Throw cares away".
Christmas is here, bringing good cheer
To young and old, meek and the bold
Ding, dong, ding, dong, That is their song,
With joyful ring, all caroling.

One seems to hear words of good cheer,
From ev'rywhere, filling the air.
O, how they pound, raising the sound,
O'er hill and dale, telling their tale.
Gaily they ring, while people sing
Songs of good cheer, Christmas is here!

O, how happy are their tones.

Merry, merry, merry, Merry Christmas!
Merry, merry, merry, Merry Christmas!
On, on they send, on without end

Their joyful tone to ev'ry home.
Hark! How the bells, sweet silver bells,
All seem to say "Throw cares away!"

Bohm!
