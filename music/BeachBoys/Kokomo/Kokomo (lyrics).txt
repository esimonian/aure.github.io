  Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take ya.
  Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama.
  Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go.
  Jamaica

Off the Florida Keys, there's a place called Kokomo.
That's where you wanna go ta get away from it all.
'N bodies in the sand. Tropical drink melting in your hand.
We'll be falling in love to the rhythm of a steel-drum band,
Down in Kokomo

  Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take ya to 
  Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama.
  Key Largo, Montego, baby why don' we go.

  <i>Ooh, I wanna take ya down ta Kokomo.
  We'll get there fast, and then we'll take it slow.
  That's where we wanna go,
  Way down da Kokomo.</i>

On Martinique, that Montserrat mystique, and

'N we'll put out to sea, and we'll perfect our chemistry.
And by and by we'll defy a little bit o' gravity.
Afternoon delight, cocktails and moonlit nights.
That dreamy look in your eye gave me a tropical contact high,
Way down in Kokomo  CHORUS

On Port-au-Prince, I wanna catch a glimpse.

SOLO

Ev'rybody knows a little place like Kokomo,
Now if you wanna go and get away from it all,
Go down to Kokomo  CHORUSES OUT
