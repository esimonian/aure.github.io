When I grow up to be a man

Will I dig the same things that turned me on as a kid?
Will I look back and say that I wish I hadn't done what I did?
Will I joke around and still dig those sounds
When I grow up to be a man?

Will I look for the same things in a woman that I dig in a girl?
Will I settle down fast or will I first wanna travel the world?
Well I'm young and free but how will it be
When I grow up to be a man?

<i>Oooooo Ooooooo Oooooooo</i>

Will my kids be proud or think their old man's really a square?
When they're out having fun yeah, will I still wanna have my share?
Will I love my wife for the rest of my life
When I grow up to be a man?
What will I be when I grow up to be a man?

Won't last forever. It's kinda sad. (REPEAT OUT)
