There's a world where I can go and tell my secrets to.
In my room. In my room.

In this world I lock out all my worries and my fears.
In my room. In my room.

<i>Do my dreaming and my scheming. Lie awake and pray.
Do my crying and my sighing. Laugh at yesterday.</i>

Now it's dark and I'm alone but I won't be afraid.
In my room. In my room.
