If ev'rybody had an ocean across the U.S.A.,
Then ev'rybody'd be surfin' like Californ-I-A.
You'd see 'em wearin' their baggies. Huarachi sandals, too.
A bushy bushy blonde hairdo. Surfin' U.S.A.

  You'll catch 'em surfin' at Del Mar. Ventura County Line.
  Santa Cruz and Trestles. Australia's Narrabeen.
  All over Manhattan, and down Doheny way.
  Ev'rybody's gone surfin'. Surfin' U.S.A.

We'll all be plannin' out a route we're gonna take real soon.
We're waxin' down our surfboard. We can't wait for June.
We'll all be gone for the summer. We're on safari to stay.
Tell the teacher we're surfin'. Surfin' U.S.A.

  At Haggerty's and Swami's. Pacific Palisades.
  San Onofre and Sunset. Redondo Beach, L.A.
  All over La Jolla, and Waimea Bay.
  Ev'rybody's gone surfin'. Surfin' U.S.A.

SOLO LIKE CHORUS' 1st THREE LINES
Ev'rybody's gone surfin'. Surfin' U.S.A.  (REPEAT OUT)
