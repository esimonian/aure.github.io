REFRAIN: Let's go surfin' now. Ev'rybody's learnin' how.
	 Come on a safari with me. Come on a safari with...

Early in the mornin' we'll be startin' out.
Some honeys will be comin' along.
We're loadin' up our woodie with our boards inside,
And headin' out singin' our song.

  Come on baby, wait and see, yes,
  I'm gonna take you surfin' with me. Come on along,
  Yes baby, wait and see, yes,
  I'm gonna take you surfin' with me.  REFRAIN

Huntington and Malibu they're shootin' the pier,
And Rincon they're walkin' the nose.
We're goin' on safari to the islands this year,
So if you're comin', get ready to go.  CHORUS / REFRAIN ("me").

SOLO LIKE VERSE

They're anglin' in Laguna and Cerro Azul.
They're kickin' out in Doheny too.
I tell ya' surfin's runnin' wild, it's gettin' bigger ev'ry day,
From Hawaii to the shores of Peru.

CHORUS / REFRAIN...
Me, yeah me, with me, yeah me, with me, yeah me
