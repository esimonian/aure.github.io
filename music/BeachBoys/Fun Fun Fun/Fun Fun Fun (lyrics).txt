Well, she got her daddy's car, and she cruised through the hamburger stand, now.
Seems she forgot all about the library like she told her old man, now.
And with the radio blasting, goes cruising just as fast as she can, now.
And she'll have

  Fun fun fun, till her daddy takes the T-Bird away.

Well, the girls can't stand her 'cause she walks, looks, and drives like an ace, now.
She makes the Indy 500 look like a Roman chariot race, now.
A lot of guys try to catch her, but she leads 'em on a wild goose chase, now.
And she'll have

  Fun fun fun, till her daddy takes the T-Bird away, T-Bird away.

SOLO

Well, you knew all along that your dad was getting' wise to you, now.
And since he took your set of keys, you've been thinking that your fun is all through, now.
But you can come along with me, 'cause we got a lot of things to do, now.
And we'll have

  Fun fun fun, now that daddy took the T-Bird away. (Top singer: "And he'll have")
  Fun fun fun, now that daddy took the T-Bird away.
