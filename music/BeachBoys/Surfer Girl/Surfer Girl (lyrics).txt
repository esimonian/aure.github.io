Ooh............
Ooh.... ahh.

Little surfer, little one. Made my heart come all undone.
Do you love me? Do you, surfer girl... ooh...

I have watched you on the shore, standing by the ocean's roar.
Do you love me? Do you, surfer girl... ooh... ooh...

<i>We could ride the surf together, while our love would grow.
In my woodie, I would take you ev'rywhere I go.</i>

So I say from me to you, I will make your dreams come true.
Do you love me? Do you, surfer.............

Girl.

Little one... ahh...  (2x)
Little one... (REPEAT OUT)
