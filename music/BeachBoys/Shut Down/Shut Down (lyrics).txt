  Tach it up, tach it up. Buddy, gonna shut you down

(Ooh, rev it up, now)
It happened on the strip, where the road is wide
Two cool sharks standin' side by side
Yeah my fuel-injected Sting Ray and a 413
We're revvin' up our engines and it sounds real mean

  Tach it up, tach it up. Buddy, gonna shut you down

(Ooh, move it out, now)
Declinin' numbers at an even rate
At the count of "1" we both accelerate
My Sting Ray is light, the slicks are startin' to spin
But the 413's really diggin' in

  Gotta be cool now, power shift, here we go

<i>Superstock Dodge is windin' out in low
But my fuel-injected Sting Ray's really startin' to go
To get the traction, I'm a-ridin' the clutch
My pressure plate's burnin', that machine's too much

SOLO (like bridge)</i>

(Ooh, honkin' on, now)
Pedal's to the floor, hear his dual quads drink
And now the 413's lead is startin' to shrink
He's hot with ram induction but it's understood
I got a fuel-injected engine sittin' under my hood

  Shut it off, shut it off. Buddy, now I shut you down (4x)
  Shut it off, shut it off. Buddy, gonna shut you down
