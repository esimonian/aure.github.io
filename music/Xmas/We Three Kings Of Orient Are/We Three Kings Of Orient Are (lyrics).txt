We three Kings of Orient are;
Bearing gifts, we traverse afar. 
Field and fountain, moor and mountain, 
Following yonder star. O,

  Star of wonder, star of night,
  Star with royal beauty bright;
  Westward leading, still proceeding, 
  Guide us to thy perfect light.

Glor'ious now behold Him arise,
King and God and Sacrifice,
Alleluia; Alleluia;
Earth to heav'n replies. O,

  Star of wonder, star of night,
  Star with royal beauty bright;
  Westward leading, still proceeding, 
  Guide us to thy perfect light.
