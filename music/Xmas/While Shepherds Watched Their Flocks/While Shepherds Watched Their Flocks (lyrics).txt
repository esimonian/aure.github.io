While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
All seated on the ground,
The angel of the Lord came down,
And glory shown around,
And glory shown around.

"Fear not", said he, for mighty dread
Had seized their troubled minds.
"Glad tidings of great joy I bring,
To you and all mankind,
To you and all mankind."

"All glory be to God on high,
And to the earth be peace;
Good will henceforth, from heav'n to me,
Begin and never cease!
Begin and never cease!"
