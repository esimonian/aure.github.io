When the night has come and the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see
No I won't be afraid, oh I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me.  So darlin', darlin'

  Stand by me.  Oh, stand by me
  Oh stand, stand by me, stand by me

If the sky that we look upon should tumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me.  And darlin', darlin'

  Stand by me.  Oh, stand by me
  Woh stand now, stand by me, stand by me

STRINGS SOLO (verse form)     And darlin', darlin'

  Stand by me.  Oh, stand by me
  Oh stand now, stand by me, stand by me
  Whenever you're in trouble won't you

  Stand by me.  Oh, stand by me
  Woh stand now, oh stand, stand by me
