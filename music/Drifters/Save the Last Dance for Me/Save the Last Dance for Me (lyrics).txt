You can dance ev'ry dance with the guy
Who gives you the eye, let him hold you tight
You can smile ev'ry smile for the man
Who held your hand 'neath the pale moonlight

  But don't forget who's takin' you home
  And in whose arms you're gonna be
  So darlin', save the last dance for me.  Mmm

Oh I know that the music's fine
Like sparkling wine, go and have your fun
Laugh and sing, but while we're apart
Don't give your heart to anyone

  But don't forget who's takin' you home
  And in whose arms you're gonna be
  So darlin', save the last dance for me.  Mmm

Baby, don't you know I love you so?
Can't you feel it when we touch?
I will never never let you go
I love you oh, so much

You can dance, go and carry on
Til the night is gone and it's time to go
If he asks if you're all alone,
Can he take you home, you must tell him "No"

  'Cause don't forget who's takin' you home
  And in whose arms you're gonna be
  So darlin', save the last dance for me

SOLO (chords like bridge)

  'Cause don't forget who's takin' you home
  And in whose arms you're gonna be
  So darlin', save the last dance for me.  Mmm
  Save the last dance for me.  Mmm hmm
  Save the last dance for me
