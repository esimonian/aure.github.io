Melinda was mine, 'til the time that I found her
Holdin' Jim, and lovin' him.
Then Sue came along, loved me strong, that's what I thought.
Me and Sue, that died too.

  Don't know that I will, but until I can find me
  A girl who'll stay and won't play games behind me,
  I'll be what I am, a solitary man, solitary man.

I've had it to here, bein' 'ware love's a small word.
Part-time thing, paper ring.
I know it's been done, havin' one girl who loves you.
Right or wrong, weak or strong.

Mmm, solitary man. (Repeat and fade)
