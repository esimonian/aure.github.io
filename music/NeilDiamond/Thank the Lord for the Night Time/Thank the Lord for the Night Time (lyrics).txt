Daytime turns me off and I don't mean maybe.
9 to 5 ain't takin' me where I'm bound.
When it's done I run out to see my baby.
We get groovin' when the sun goes down.

  I thank the Lord for the night time, to forget the day.
  A day of up, uptight time... baby chase it away.
  I get a relaxation, and it's a time to groove.
  I thank the Lord for the night time.  I thank the Lord for you.

I'll talk about plans now baby, I got plenty.
But nothin' ever seems to turn out the way it should.
Talk about money... girl, I ain't got any.
Seems like just one time I'm feelin' good.

CHORUS

INSTRUMENTAL
Seems like just one time I'm feelin' good.

CHORUS

I thank the Lord for the night time.  I thank the Lord for you.
REPEAT AND FADE
