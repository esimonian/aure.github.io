Far, we've been traveling far,
Without a home but not without a star.
Free, only want to be free.
We huddle close, and hang onto that dream.
On the boats and on the planes,
They're coming to America.
Never looking back again,
They're coming to America.

<i>Home, don't it seem so far away?
But we're traveling light today.
In the eye of the storm,
In the eye of the storm.
Home, to a new and a shiny place.
Make our bed, we'll say our grace.
Freedom's light burnin' warm.
Freedom's light burnin' warm.</i>

Everywhere around the world,
They're comin' to America.
Every time that flag's unfurled.
They're comin' to America.
Got a dream to take them there.
They're comin' to America.
Got a dream they've come to share.
They're comin' to America.

They're comin' to America. (4x)
Today! (5x)

My country 'tis of thee.
Sweet land of liberty.
Of thee I sing.
Of thee I sing
Today! (5x)
