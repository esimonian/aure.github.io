It's another Tequila Sunrise
Starin' slowly 'cross the sky
Said goodbye
He was just a hired hand
Workin' on the dreams he planned to try
The days go by

<i>Ev'ry night, when the sun goes down
Just another lonely boy in town
And she's out runnin' round</i>

She wasn't just another woman
And I couldn't keep from comin' on
It's been so long
Woh, and it's a hollow feelin'
When it comes down to dealin' friends
It never ends

<i>Take another shot of courage
Wonder why the right words never come
You just get numb</i>

It's another Tequila Sunrise
This ol' world still looks the same
Another frame
