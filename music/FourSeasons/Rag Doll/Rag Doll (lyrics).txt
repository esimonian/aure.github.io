Ooh, ooh
Aah, ooh

When she was just a kid
Her clothes were hand-me-downs
They always laughed at her
When she came into town, called her

"Rag Doll, little Rag Doll."
Such a pretty face should be dressed in lace

Ooh, ooh

I'd change her sad rags
Into glad rags if I could
My folks won't let me, 'cause they
Say that she's no good, "She's a

Rag Doll, such a Rag Doll."

Though I love her so, I can't let her know

Ooh ooh

Aah, I love you just the way you are

Hoh
Ooh
Hoh
